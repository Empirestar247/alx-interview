# Prime Game Project

##Overview

This project involves implementing a competitive game where two players, Maria and Ben, take turns choosing prime numbers from a set of consecutive integers and removing them along with their multiples. The player who cannot make a move loses the game. The project aims to determine the winner of each round, assuming optimal play from both players.

## Concepts Utilized
Prime Numbers: Understanding and identifying prime numbers within a given range.
Sieve of Eratosthenes: An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers.
Game Theory: Principles of competitive games and optimal decision-making.
Dynamic Programming: Optimizing solutions for multiple rounds using previous results.
Python Programming: Implementing game logic and algorithms using Python.

##Usage
Ensure Python 3 is installed.
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Run the main Python script to execute the game.

##Example
Input: Number of rounds and an array of integers for each round.
Output: Name of the player who won the most rounds or None if the winner cannot be determined.

##Requirements
Python 3.4.3 or later.
PEP 8 style adherence.
Executable files.
